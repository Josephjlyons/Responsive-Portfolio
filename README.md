## Application Link

[Deployed Application](https://josephjlyons.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

## Purpose
Created a simple responsive web design that uses bootstrap to make sure everything renders on the page correctly on any size viewport. Purpose of this project was to develope a webpage that gives the user information about myself.


## Code Used
* HTML
* CSS
* BootStrap

## How to use
Fairly simple instructions, to access the secondary pages (portfolio and contact) the user simply has to use the navbar at the top of the page to cycle through the pages with a click on the self titled pages. 

## Mentions
Help along the way came from the teacher, TA, tutor from bootcampspot and outside website resources.
